# weather-app-project
This is a weather app project coded in Python for my subject Introduction to Programming, one of the subjects in my Cybersecurity course. 

It is divided into three files, airqualityapi.py, weatherapi.py, and weatherapp.py. the first two serve as an API, courtesy of Open-Meteo, an open-source meteorology forecast API service. While weatherapp.py is the app itself that includes GUI.
